Starting in the top left corner of a 2x2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6
routes to the bottom right corner.

How many such routes are there through a 20x20 grid?


The solution to this problem can be broken down into to a combinatorics problem
of different way to move down and to the right.

Example: DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR

Using the binomial theorem: 40! / (20! * (40 - 20)!) = 137846528820
