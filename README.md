# Project-Euler

My goal is to solve the first 100 problems in various programming languages.  
Includeing but no limited to:  

- pecil and paper (only possible for some of the problems)
- x86-64 assembly
- c
- python
- haskell
- rust
- zig
- odin

For the problems that are easier to solve by hand I will not implement in code.

Hopefully this is useful to someone.
